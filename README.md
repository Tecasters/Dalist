Remote Sensing (Daljinska istra≈æivanja) course laboratory exercise and project.

FER (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing), academic year 2024/2025

In this course we learnt the principles of radar remote sensing through the lens of digital signal processing. 
The goal of the course was to be able to reconstruct a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image from raw data that students captured themselves. 

The first laboratory exercise was more theoretical and dealt with the applications of Sentinel imagery. 

The second laboratory exercise involved finding out the distance of a metal sheet using an FMCW radar, and the speed of a metal sheet using a CW radar.

Implementing the final project meant developing a script that would take the raw data (of a metal can in front of a GB-SAR) and running it through a student's own implementation of the Omega-K algorithm, thus having a reconstructed image as the output.
